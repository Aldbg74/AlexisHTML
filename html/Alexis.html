    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        <h4>How i am ?</h4>
        I am Alexis, I am 21 years old at the time of writing these lines! <br>
        Novice in programming, I had initially studied in a design office (use of CAD software), before choosing to convert to IT, <br>
        (a field that has always plagued me) following the COVID pandemic. <br>
        
        <h4>How do i learn programming ?</h4>
        I learn programing at my first "piscine" in the school 42 of Lyon. <br>
        I continue to learn thanks to the internet and the different books on the subject. <br>
        
        <h4>What I would like in the future</h4>
        The big question, I would like to pass my 2nd "piscine" at 42 Lyon, and I will see later. <br>
        I would probably specialize in video games or cybersecurity (or maybe something else if I'm in love with it) <br>
        And I would really like to open my own company <br>
        
        <h4>My hobbies</h4>
        Computers aside, I like : <br>
        
        Video Games 🎮 / Role play games 🎲 / Reding 📘 / Long Walk Outside 🚶‍♂️(Yeah Dev go outside sometimes)
